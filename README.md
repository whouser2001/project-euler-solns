# project-euler-solns

My solutions to various project euler (projecteuler.net) problems. The site presents number theory problems that must be solved by computer algorithm, training both programming skills and mathematical intuition.

Solutions are organized by difficulty level, which is designated for each problem on the website. 

I present this as an example of a coding project I have worked on in my spare time; I feel it is a relevant display of my enjoyment of CS and math. However, I don't wish to spoil the experience of solving for users. If requested, I can remove solutions to problems >100.
